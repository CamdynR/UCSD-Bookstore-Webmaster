<p>We want your students to have their course materials when they are needed. In order to ensure that books are on the shelves for the first day of class, please submit your course materials adoptions as early as possible; this allows us to research titles as necessary, seek as many used copies as possible (including student Buy-Back during finals), work with publishers to lower textbook costs, and resolve out-of-stock and out-of-print problems.<br />
